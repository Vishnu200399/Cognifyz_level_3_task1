![Project Preview](project-preview.png)

ðŸš€ I'm excited to share the completion of Level 3, Task 1 at Cognifyz Technologies, where I worked on the topic of Image Manipulation.

For this task, I implemented a basic image gallery using HTML and CSS with the following features:
- Thumbnail images that enlarge when clicked.
- A simple image slideshow that automatically transitions between images.

## Project Highlights

- **HTML and CSS Mastery:** This project allowed me to hone my skills in HTML and CSS, creating a visually appealing and interactive image gallery.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The image gallery is user-friendly, with thumbnail images that expand for a better view and a slideshow feature for automated image transitions.
